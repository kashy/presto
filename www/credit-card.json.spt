"""Save a payment method token (balanced_customer_href) for a user.

When the user fills out the payment details form in the UI, we send the new
info to Balanced (using the balanced.js library). Balanced always gives us a
single-use token in return, provided that the credit card info validated. This
present script is called next. It takes the token and tries to associate it with
a Balanced account object (creating one as needed).
